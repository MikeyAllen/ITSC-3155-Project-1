    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal here at the Greenhouse and Gardens at the University of North Carolina at <br>
        Charlotte is to help students conect with nature while at the same time helping  <br>
        paying their bills and tuition. Studies show that even just 20 minutes a week in<br>
        nature without teachnology will improve the a persons mental health and alievate stress.<br>
